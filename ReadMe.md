## Synopsis

Down deep in Montana California, a young boy and his adopted older brother go for a walk into the woods hunting. Johnny, the younger boy, has his rifle in his hands and notices a large wolf in the distance. The wolf jumps on Keef attacking his arm while Keef is now pinned on the floor! Johnny tries to load his rifle but drops it into a hole, a deep one! Mikie, a member of the 300 clan, springs into action in aid of the wolf and begins to hit Keef with his club he stole from Eli, Mikie's younger brother. Billy just stood there and watched.

Because Billy just stood there and watched he is forced by the local village to be sacrificed to the volcano gods of the ancient world. This sacrifice is more than sufficient, and as a result, wolves everywhere are completely eradicated and there is world peace.

But this world peace doesn't last long, and the wolf god Nightbane gets upset at the god Vulcanious. So the two gods start a war between each other. Nightbane brings wolves back to live but they're 20 feet tall. Here's where it get's interesting. Vulcanious brings Billy back from the dead and uses him as tribute to the god of Wolves! SO the war ends and everyone lives happily ever after.
